# 📊 E-commerce Customer Churn & Retention Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
I developed this Business Intelligence project to analyze customer attrition (churn) within an e-commerce ecosystem. By processing data from **6,000 customers**, this dashboard identifies high-risk segments and provides data-driven recommendations to optimize retention strategies and safeguard long-term revenue.

## 🔍 Dashboard Insights & Economic Analysis

### **1. Tenure & Loyalty Patterns**
The analysis reveals a significant "New User Vulnerability." Customers with a **tenure of < 6 months** account for **770 out of the 948 total churned users**. From an economic perspective, this suggests a high friction point during the initial onboarding or a failure in the early-stage value proposition.

### **2. Product Category Hotspots**
* **Mobile Phones:** Highest churn volume with a **27.40% churn rate**.
* **Fashion:** Secondary risk area with a **10.24% churn rate**.
This indicates that high-competition categories require more aggressive loyalty incentives compared to stable categories like Groceries.

### **3. Purchasing Behavior & Incentives**
The dashboard correlates **Average Cashback** with payment methods (E-wallets, Credit Cards, etc.). Retained customers typically engage with specific cashback thresholds, suggesting that price elasticity and promotional sensitivity are key drivers of retention.

### **4. Geographic & Demographic Trends**
* **City Tiers:** Attrition varies across City Tiers 1, 2, and 3, allowing for localized marketing spend.
* **Demographics:** Gender and Marital Status slices provide a granular view for personalized retention campaigns.
